# FAQ
_**Q: What all happened with your 2017 Shelby GT350?**_<br />
A: In less than three years, I've had the following issues:<br />
* 1x New Clutch
* 1x New Transmission
* 5x Alternators
* 1x PCM
* 2-3 Multiple AC Compressors (lost count)
* 1x brake service (squealing)
* 1x engine oil cooler tube assembly
* 1x engine (current issue)

_**Q: What modifications did you have done to the car?**_<br />
A: I had the following modifications:
* Full american racing exhaust and conservative lund tune (for check engine light -- deleted cat converters)
* MGW Shifter
* Raceseng Shift Knob
* Watson 4-point bolt-in roll cage
* Project 6GR wheels
* Michelin Pilot Sport 4S (305x19 and 325x19)
* Tire Stickers (via tirestickers.com)
* ZL1 Addons Tow Hook

_**Q: What modification was the most worth it?**_<br />
A: Other than the exhaust system, which I absolutely loved, I got the most use out of the tow hook. I can attest that the ZL1 Addons tow hook works extremely well and is very durable for multiple usages beyond any reasonable expectations.

_**Q: How many times have you taken it to the track?**_<br />
A: Unfortunately, I've only had the chance to have two open track days and 1 auto cross session, all were within the first few months of owning the car, over 2.5 years ago since owning the car.

_**Q: Why didn't you file for a lemon way beforehand?**_<br />
A: Unfortunately, my issues started happening right outside of the mileage range that the lemon law states. Additionally, my issues were never repetitive until outside of the lemon law mileage requirements. Also, considering it was my dream car, I kept believing and hoping that every issue I had would be my last issue, and unfortunately this bit me in the ass.

_**Q: What happened with the car?**_<br />
A: While driving in Atlanta, the car made a loud "thump" sound and the car immediately shut off. After getting into the emergency lane, I was unable to start the car. A month later, Ford confirmed that the engine rod bearings had gotten locked up and that the starter was fried. See video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UM1nQggSPa4

_**Q: Did you check your car for oil prior to the engine failure?**_<br />
A: My engine failed shortly after getting an oil change (approx a few days of driving it). After moving to Atlanta, I informed my dealership about all of the engine oil issues I've heard about due to technicians not putting enough oil in the car. They told me that this wouldn't be an issue. I didn't check to see if enough oil was in the car since I trusted the dealership and it was only just days later. 

_**Q: What was the reason for the dealership denying your warranty for the engine replacement?**_<br />
A: Sadly, neither the dealership nor Ford Customer Care provided me any specifics on what their determination was, other than "modifications". I have been unable to retrieve any further information or any proof whatsoever. All of the issues I've had with this car has been covered under warranty without any question and the modifications have been on the car since shortly after having it delivered.

_**Q: What car are you considering getting next?**_<br />
A: I purchased the GT350 because I never saw them on the road and loved how they looked, sound, and drove. There's no other american muscle car that I think I would feel "exclusive" with except for perhaps the ZL1 1LE. However, I've started looking at Porsche Cayman and Carerra models and have gained a lot of interest in possibly going this route.

_**Q: What advice would you give to someone who's considering buying a GT350?**_<br />
A: Choose your dealership wisely. My experience with three dealerships were perfectly fine in and around New Orleans, including the service advisors and the technicians. Sadly, one dealership could essentially give you hell while the other may become your best friend and will do whatever it takes to keep you as a happy customer.

_**Q: Did you talk with Ford Customer Care?**_<br />
A: Ford Customer Care has been just "OK" with following up with the dealership; however, your case can easily fall through the cracks. In fact, it had gone two weeks without me hearing from Ford Customer Care and despite me telling them that it's been so long and I needed a follow up, they just simply told me to wait. A week or so later, I was told that my rep went on vacation.

Update (03/09/20): After comparing OASIS reports with Ford Customer Care, it turns out that ESP actually did not inspect the car and, instead, immediately denied coverage after identifying modifications on the car. This occurred back in October and I had never been notified. A refund check was also issued back in October and I was unaware of this.

_**Q: Would you get another GT350?**_<br />
A: Sadly, I would not. My experience with Ford's customer service has been extremely disastrous. Although I believe that, if I made different decisions about my dealership selections, my experiences next time would go a lot smoother.
